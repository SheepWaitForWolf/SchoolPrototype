    <p> <strong>Welcome to myaccount School Portal</strong> <br>
    <br>
     Register an account to simplify and secure the process of updating your childs school records. 
        In conjunction with SEEMiS Group we will verify your details and allow parents access to their childs records to ensure they are kept up to date. 
        We will never share your details with any third party and we will ensure that only a legal parent/guardian has access to your childs records.
        Once your account has been activated, you will be able to enrol your child in school, pay for school meals, report absences, provide details for our annual update and view 
        your child's exam results and report cards all from one secure account.

    <p> <strong>What is myaccount?</strong> <br>
        <br>
myaccount is a simple, secure way to access a range of Scottish public services online using just one username and password. 
Provided by the Improvement Service and funded by the Scottish Government, it is completely free and entirely voluntary. It is
 the only authentication and data management solution in Scotland officially backed by the Scottish Government. This site was
  launched in April 2014 and is regularly being updated as and when new service providers (from eligible Scottish public sector
   organisations) choose to deliver online services. myaccount is designed to work nationwide - giving public sector 
   organisations across Scotland a shared, secure method of verifying who you are online.</p>
