		<p> <strong>Accessibility and Help </strong><br>
			<br>
		The accessibility of schoolportal.com is important to us and we work with several organisations that 
		help disabled people to use computers and the internet. </p>

		<p> We are committed to ensure our website works with preferred technologies, including making our site 
		accessible if you are visually impaired. By anonymously monitoring browsers, operating systems and screen
	 	solutions we see how they change over time allowing us to adapt and adjust schoolportal.com to ensure itâ€™s simple and
	 	 easy to use. </p>
